# CS - Introduction to C++ - CS110A 
C++ Assignments and Code 
/************************
My main and preferred language is Java. The extend of my C++ coding experience is input, output, boolean if else if statements, variables (int, double, String, Char). I took an Introduction to C++ class but didn't go any further because i didn't see enough immediate practical uses for it and Java seems to have more uses. I took C++ just to get some extra units in.
